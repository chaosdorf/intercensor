# db/access.host
#
# put IPv4 and IPv6 hostnames (reverse names) allowed to connect here
# use db/access.dyndns for hosts without proper reverse name
# use db/access.ip for IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses
# empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
# regular expression matching is used here,
# hostnames are converted to lowercase before matching
#
# Examples:
#^menuhin\.burden\.eu\.org$
#^.*\.mydomain\.org$
#
# This would allow everyone with a valid reverse name to connect:
#.*
