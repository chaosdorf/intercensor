# scanbuffmethod
#
# As of 2.9.4.0, DG uses libclamav's cl_scandesc method instead of
# cl_scanbuff when scanning memory buffers. Unfortunately, this means
# that memory contents must be written to a file before scanning even
# if the file is below maxcontentramcachescansize.
# This option specifies how temp files will be created:
#
#   file - create files in scanbuffdir
#
#   shm - use POSIX shared memory
#
scanbuffmethod = 'file'

# scanbuffdir - where to create temp files in scanbuffmethod 'file'.
# You can specify a ramfs/tmpfs partition to minimise performance
# impact.
# Defaults to the configured filecachedir.
#scanbuffdir = '/path/to/tmpfs'

# tempdir - temporary directory for internal use by clamav.
# When scanning archive files, clamav can create temporary files of
# its own; this allows you to specify where they will be created.
# Used regardless of scanbuffmethod.
# Defaults to the configured filecachedir.
#tempdir = '/path/to/tmpfs'

#maxfiles - The maximum number of files to scan from a single
# archive.  Like clamd.conf's MaxFiles.
maxfiles = 15000

#maxreclevel - The maximum recursion level when unpacking archives
# within archives.  Like clamd.conf's MaxRecursion.
maxreclevel = 10

#maxscansize - Upper limit on the amount of data that whill be
# scanned when unpacking an archive, in kilobytes. Like clamd.conf's
# MaxScanSize.
maxscansize = 100000
