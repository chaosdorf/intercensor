#
# The purpose of this script is just to show the variables that are
# available to all the scripts in this directory. All these scripts
# are called from /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script, which exports all the
# variables shown before. If you want to debug a problem with your DHCP
# setup you can enable this script and take a look at
# /tmp/dhclient-script.debug.

# To enable this script set the following variable to "yes"
RUN="no"
