## Intercensor 1.0 ("Zensurbox")

The very first intercensor version (back then called "Zensursulas Blackbox" /
"Zensurbox") was created around autumn 2009. Ursula v.d.L. aka Zensursula is a
german politician in favour of internet censorship, which lead to the name of
the box. Back then there were three levels, each of them accessible through a
different switch. We later added a web interface, so that only one switch was
needed.

## Intercensor 2.0

We now have version 2 of the box. It features a really neat web interface, new
and also more challenges (right now we have five, more are planned), we will
also soon add a highscore so that users can see how good/fast they were.

## On Tour

A few events we visited with Interncensor:

#### OpenRheinRuhr 2009

[[!img orr09_box.jpg size=400x]]
The very first version. The three switches provided the levels "Leyenhaft"
(easy, DNS censorship), "1 2 3 4 (B)Eckstein" (transparent http proxy) and
"Zen Sur (made in china)" (http stringmatch, all other ports blocked).

Since the OpenRheinRuhr is not that much of a hacker-event, we provided a
laptop for guests who wanted to play but didn't have their own hardware with
them.

#### 26C3

A later version, the grey box under the Dell Notebook. Already using the web
interface.

Fun fact: Ethernet ports were quite rare on our table, so we frequently had
people connected to the Zensurbox who actually just wanted a seat and
internet. Luckily, they all managed to bypass the easiest level :)

We also held a [Lightning
Talk](http://www.chaosdorf.de/projekte/zensurbox/26c3_lt.avi) about the
project.

#### FrOSCon 2010

[[!img froscon10_box.jpg size=400x]]
We also had a small booth on the FrOSCon (west german OpenSource conference)

#### 27C3

This was the first event we visited with the second version. We even managed
to get reserved seats!

Overall, reception of the box was very good â€“ We had quite some players, and
and most of them were easily able to bypass most (or even all) censorship
methdos.
