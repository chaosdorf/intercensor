# Intercensor

In the past years there was a lot of discussion about internet censorship.  To
get an actual impression of censorship implementation details and
circumvention methods, we created the Intercensor Project.  It gives you a
switch with censored internet, and your task is to connect to it and
circumvent the various censorship levels.

If you are interested, you can contact us via IRC: #intercensor on
irc.oftc.net.
