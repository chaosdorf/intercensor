# Intercensor

In the past years there was a lot of discussion about internet censorship.  To
get an actual impression of censorship implementation details and
circumvention methods, we created the Intercensor Project.  It gives you a
switch with censored internet, and your task is to connect to it and
circumvent the various censorship levels. The more creative your solution, the
better.

This is meant to show the various methods a government can use to censor their
citizen's internet access.

## Zensurbox 1.0

The very first version was called "Zensursulas Blackbox" (Ursula v.d.L. aka
Zensursula is a german politician in faviour of internet censorship). There
were three switches (and later one switch + web interface) where the user
could choose their level of censorship. Each level had a different task.

We held a [Lightning
Talk](http://www.chaosdorf.de/projekte/zensurbox/26c3_lt.avi) about the
project on the 26C3.

Version 2 of the box is mostly finished by now. We now have a shiny web
interface with account registration and a bunch of new challenges, and are
working on even more. A highscore is also planned.

If you are interested, you can contact us via IRC: #intercensor on
irc.oftc.net.
