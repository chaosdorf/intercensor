In the past years there was a lot of discussion about internet censorship.  To
get an actual impression of censorship implementation details and
circumvention methods, we created the Intercensor Project.  It gives you a
switch with censored internet, and your task is to connect to it and
circumvent the various censorship levels. The more creative your solution, the
better.

This is meant to show the various methods a government can use to censor their
citizen's internet access. See also our [26C3 Lightning
Talk](http://www.chaosdorf.de/projekte/zensurbox/26c3_lt.avi) for more
information.

To play the game, either visit us at the
[Chaosdorf](https://www.chaosdorf.de/) (german Hackerspace in DÃ¼sseldorf) or
come to one of the events we usually attend (most notably the annual Chaos
Communication Congress). Help from interested coders or designers is also much
appreciated.

All interested parties are welcome to visit our IRC Channel, #intercensor on
OFTC (irc.oftc.net).
